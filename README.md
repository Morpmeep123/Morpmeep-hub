🚨 MORPMEEP HUB - NEW UPDATE!!! 🚨
"NOTHING TOO MUCH!"
Okay, okay, maybe it’s more than nothing 😏

🔥 What’s New?
We’ve been cooking up a fresh new update just for YOU. Check out what’s in store:

✅ MOBILE-FRIENDLY UI!
That’s right — Morpmeep Hub is no longer “PC ONLY”! You can now use it on touchscreen devices with a clean and optimized layout. Smaller screen? No problem.

✅ UI REDESIGN
Slightly smaller GUI to fit better on all devices

New toggle button to open/close the menu whenever you want

Clean draggable window with rounded design

✅ ESP GREEN OUTLINES
Player boxes are now sleek green outlines, helping you see everyone clearly without visual clutter.

✅ SILLY GUITAR AUTO-PLAYER 🎸
We added a fun music system! Press a button, and the Silly Guitar plays "Ging Gang Goolie" automatically with a rhythm delay. And when you're done? Just press E to stop!

✅ PERFORMANCE & PATCHES
Faster button response

Safer teleportation

Optimized tool grabber & fly

🎮 Game Support Plans
We know… BAER is getting a bit repetitive. So we’re officially expanding Morpmeep Hub to work in more games very soon! Expect more tools, more fun, and more silliness.

💚 From The Dev
Thanks for using Morpmeep Hub and supporting the project! We’re just getting started.
